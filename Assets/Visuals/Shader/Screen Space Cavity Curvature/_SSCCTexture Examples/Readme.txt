Feel free to ignore this if you're using the "Screen" output mode of the asset, having it applied all over the screen.

-------
This folder contains example shaders for if you want to use the "_SSCCTexture in shaders" output mode of the asset.
This allows you to selectively apply the effect to certain objects / filter our the others.
Only available for Builtin(2019/2020/2021), URP(2020/2021). Unfortunately not available for URP(2019) and HDRP(at all).

Import appropriate .unitypackage for an example implementation of how to sample _SSCCTexture in shaders.
